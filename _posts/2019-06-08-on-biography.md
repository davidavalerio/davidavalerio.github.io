I'd like to discuss how we can improve how history is taught. In particular I want to ramble about why I think biography is one of the best ways for people to learn history. As child I enjoyed learning Cuban history through spending time with my grandmother, who's originally from Cuba. I would just sit around her apartment and ask her questions about what Cuba was like, and what it was like for her to leave after the Cuban Revolution and come to a completely different country, the United States. I found that that focusing on personal narrative was one of the best ways that that people can appreciate history. We, as people, we are designed to care about other people. 

But in high school, we get out our textbooks, we'll read a chapter a week about some historical period, and are expected to believe this grand historical narrative that's written in an outdated textbook. It's not like reading through statistics, or reading through as series of dates has ever attracted anybody. Ok maybe some people out there who love that stuff, but for the vast majority of learners that method is useless. If anything, it turns people off history who should really be engrossed by it. 

If we really want people to get an appreciation for history, we have to teach it in a way that is evocative. It's a failure of our system to teach history in the driest way possible and then complain that people have no sense of history. You can give people all the statistics you want, you can try to lay out this linear narrative about how some historical event went down, this happened which led to this and this happened etc. But people don't care about that. It isn't on the appropriate scale. Individual histories are more appropriate.

We care about personal histories. We care about our family histories. We care about history, on a small scale. I think reading biography is the best way to read history. I read a lot of biographies as a child, I loved learning about the lives of interesting people. As I read biographies of Albert Einstein, Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln or whoever, that really just inspired me and made me want to dig into the society they lived in. That's what I think that's what I think one of the best parts about reading biography, it serves as a foorhold for you to get into literally any subject. Let's say you don't necessarily know much about the rise of modern India. But of course, everybody has heard of Mahatma Gandhi. So if you read a biography of Mahatma Gandhi, you learn about a lot of the crucial events leading to Indian independence. Of course, this is looking through the lens of one person. But it gives you the opportunity to jump into any number of interesting subjects. So if you read his biography, and you learn about his marriage, or his relationships with women, that's a jumping off point for you to go investigate the caste system, gender relations or any other number of things. It makes these subjects much more interesting, because you see how they intersect in one person's life.

It opens you up to how grand and information packed history is. It makes you skeptical of grand historical narratives because it just shows how much filtering has to occur for the historical record to even be a record. If you see how much chance impacts the lives of individuals, imagine how much it impacts history in general. Even for like the most well recorded event in hisotry, there's just so much that is hidden from us. Biography helps you really understand that history, or that the historical narratives that we are given are not foolproof. And that they are obviously missing out on so much of the human experience.

In order for us to really teach history in a way that is intuitive, and that gives people inspiration to learn on their own. We have to let them read biography. We should shape our classes around the lives of the people who experienced history. Of course that could lead you to the Big Man Theory of History, but I don't think it does. Reading biography does not does not lead you to this theory of history as being focused on the individual. If anything, I think it shows you how, how, just how much coincidence plays into what happens in history.
