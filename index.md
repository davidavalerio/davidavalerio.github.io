Howdy! I’m David Valerio, a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences](https://earthscience.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) working in Dr. Laurence Yeung’s [research group](https://www.yeunglab.org/).

I'm interested in developing novel dissolved gas tracers to help understand biogeochemical cycling in the past and present ocean. I aam curretly devoloping novel clumped isotope proxies to improve our understanding of microbial processes in the surface and deep ocean. After completing my Ph.D., I'd like to move into the startup world to work at the interface between microbiology, stable isotope geochemistry, and oceanography in order to help solve some of the most important problems facing the world ocean today. 

Besides doing research, I read books, lift weights, go to concerts, and evangelize for the greatest city in the world, Houston, Texas. I enjoy reading history, biography, science fiction and philosophical novels. I also blog when I feel like it.
