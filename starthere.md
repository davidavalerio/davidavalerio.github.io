Howdy! I’m David Valerio, a first-year Ph.D student in the [Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences](https://earthscience.rice.edu/) at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/) working in Dr. Laurence Yeung’s [research group](https://www.yeunglab.org/).

Research-wise, I am interested in developing new clumped isotope tracers to help understand biogeochemical cycling in the past and the present. I aim to apply stable isotope techniques to better characterize microbial processes in the surface and deep ocean. Besides doing research, I read books, lift weights, go to punk shows, and evangelize for the greatest city in the world, Houston, Texas. I also blog when the mood strikes me (rarely).
